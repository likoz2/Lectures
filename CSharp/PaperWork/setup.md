## Tips

# Visual Studio
VS is an IDE for C/C++/C# and other .NET languages. Therefore it is easy to set things up. To use the languages you just install them in the "VS Installer". Setting up a new project is very easy and is done via UI. The only downfall of VS is the size of the app which goes into tens of gigabytes. That is why I recommend "VS code".
