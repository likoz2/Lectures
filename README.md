# Lectures
This is a repo for all the C# lectures I will provide.

There are `articles` and `examples`. You can jump between `articles` and `examples` in any order you like.

## Articles
It is advised to read articles in the following order:
- setup.md -> Explains how to setup an environment for C# development. (Work In Progress)
- introduction.md -> Introduction to basics of C#. If you are coming from other programming language this should be enough to create your first app.
- introduction_algorithm_example.md -> First algorithm example based on knowledge from the introduction.md.
- variables.md -> More advanced information about the correct usage of variables.
- methods.md -> More advanced and more complete information about methods in C#.
- classes.md -> More advanced information about classes. (WIP)

## Examples
The examples are sorted by difficulty and do not correspond to any articles. Examples corresponding to articles are in between the articles. (such as introduction_algorithm_example.md)
